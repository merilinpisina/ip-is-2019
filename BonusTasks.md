## **Sum of minimum elements of all possible sub-arrays of an array**

Given an array arr[], the task is to find the sum of the minimum elements of every possible sub-array of the array.

***Examples:***

*Input:* arr[] = {1, 3, 2}

*Output:* 15

All possible sub-arrays are {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 3}, {3, 2} and {1, 3, 2}

And, the sum of all the minimum elements is 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 15

*Input:* arr[] = {3, 1}

*Output:* 5

## **C++ program to print a spiral matrix**

Printing a spiral matrix up to given number using C++ program: 

A spiral matrix is a matrix consist of natural numbers up to n^2. Starting from one the numbers start increasing around the corner matrix then goes inside up to the middle element making the shape of the spiral or jalebi.

***For example:***

A spiral matrix for n=5

```
1   2   3   4   5

16  17  18  19  6

15  24  25  20  7 

14  23  22  21  8

13  12  11  10  9
```
