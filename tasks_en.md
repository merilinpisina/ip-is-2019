## Task 1
* Prompt the user to input two positive integers. Variables: firstNum and secondNum (firstNum must be less than secondNum) (use while loop); create a user-defined function called validateUserInput() to validate the user's input. Use Call-by-Value. validateUserInput() is a value returning function.


* Output all odd numbers between firstNum and secondNum. (use while loop); create a user-defined function called oddNumbers(). Use Call-by-Value. oddNumbers() is a void function.


* Output the sum of all even numbers between firstNum and secondNum. (use while loop); create a user-defined function called sumEvenNumbers(). Use Call-by-Value. Declare a variable called sumEven in the main() for the sumEvenNumbers(). sumEvenNumbers() is a value returning function. Use sumEven to hold a returned value.


* Output the numbers and their squares between 1 and 10. (use while loop): create a user-defined function called displaySquareNumbers(). Call-by-Value. displaySquareNumbers() is a void function.


* Output the sum of the square of the odd numbers between firstNum and secondNum. (use while loop); create a user-defined function called sumSqureOddNumbers(). Use Call-by-Value. Declare a variable called sumSquareOdd in the main(), for the sumSqureOddNumbers(). sumSqureOddNumbers() is a value returning function. Use sumSquareOdd to hold a returned value.


* Output all uppercase letters. (use while loop); create a user-defined function called displayUppercaseLetters(). Use Call-by-Value. displayUppercaseLetters() is a void function.

## Task 2: Pascal triangle

This is another C++ exercise about using two-dimensional array of C++. By using two-dimensional array, write C++ program to display a table that represents a Pascal triangle of any size. In Pascal triangle, the first and the second rows are set to 1. Each element of the triangle (from the third row downward) is the sum of the element directly above it and the element to the left of the element directly above it. See the example Pascal triangle(size=5) below:

```
1				
1	1			
1	2	1		
1	3	3	1	
1	4	6	4	1
```
